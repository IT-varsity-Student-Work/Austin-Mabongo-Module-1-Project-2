        <p>Clint Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa (the Hawkeye State!), where his father worked as a butcher. When his parents were killed in a car crash, Clint was sent to live in an orphanage and foster homes. He quickly escaped, however, and joined a travelling circus.While working at the circus, Clint was taken under the wing of two performers: Trick Shot (an archer) and the Swordsman (a swordsman, obviously), who taught him archery. Clint had natural gifts, and was soon a popular draw with the circus, eventually adopting the stage name Hawkeye.</p>
